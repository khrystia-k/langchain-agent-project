A biopic about the complicated legacy of Michael Jackson was always going to be an ambitious undertaking.

The planned release of the film, starring Jaafar Jackson as his late uncle, has been moved from April to October, reportedly due to complications with the script, according to a recent story from Puck.

A representative for Lionsgate, the distributor of “Michael,” declined to comment when contacted by CNN.

Here’s what we know about the project so far.
